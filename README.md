This project is for learning more how to manipulate the queue data type.

I have been completing challenges from [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?page=1&category=Queue&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions&itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=leftbar&itm_campaign=practice_header) and each of these challenges
are listed on separate branches (for the most part!).

I've also included some pytest scripts in order to practice using this tool.

The following is present:

### Easy Problems
- Implementation of queue data structure in Python - there were issues with using this for the coding problems, so moved on to using the in built library with deque
- Reversing a queue 
- [Generate binary numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/generate-binary-numbers-1587115620/1?page=1&category=Queue&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions) - initially attempted with simple queue, but was unsuccessful and had to look up a solution
- [Reverse First k elements of Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-first-k-elements-of-queue/1?page=1&category=Queue&difficulty=Easy&sortBy=submissions) - initially attempted with simple queue, but was unsuccesful and had to look up a solution
### Medium Problems
- [First non-repeating character in a stream](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream1216/1?page=1&category=Queue&sortBy=submissions)
